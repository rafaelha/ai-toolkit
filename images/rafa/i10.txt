TOK is depicted with short, dark hair styled in a small bun, standing outdoors on a street bordered by buildings. TOK gazes to the right with a neutral expression, dressed in a gray T-shirt. The scene includes a row of colorful buildings, featuring pastel green and beige facades with architectural details like balconies and barred windows. The street seems narrow, and another person can be seen in the distance, possibly seated on a scooter. The image is illuminated by warm, natural light, suggesting it was taken during the day.
